Levenberg Marquardt curve fitting in CUDA.

Homepage: [github.com/gpufit/Gpufit](https://github.com/gpufit/Gpufit)

The manuscript describing Gpufit is now published in [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15313-9).

## Quick start instructions

To verify that Gpufit is working correctly on the host computer, go to the folder gpufit_performance_test of the binary package and run Gpufit_Cpufit_Performance_Comparison.exe.  Further details of the test executable can be found in the documentation package.

## Binary distribution

The latest Gpufit binary release, supporting Windows 32-bit and 64-bit machines, can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/gpufit/Gpufit/releases).

## Documentation

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/gpufit/badge/?version=latest)](http://gpufit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Documentation for the Gpufit library may be found online ([latest documentation](http://gpufit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)), and also
as a PDF file in the binary distribution of Gpufit.

## Building Gpufit from source code

Instructions for building Gpufit are found in the documentation: [Building from source code](https://github.com/gpufit/Gpufit/blob/master/docs/installation.rst).

## Using the Gpufit binary distribution

Instructions for using the binary distribution may be found in the documentation.  The binary package contains:

- The Gpufit SDK, which consists of the 32-bit and 64-bit DLL files, and 
  the Gpufit header file which contains the function definitions.  The Gpufit
  SDK is intended to be used when calling Gpufit from an external application
  written in e.g. C code.
- Gpufit Performance test: A simple console application comparing the execution speed of curve fitting on the GPU and CPU.  This program also serves as a test to ensure the correct functioning of Gpufit.
- Matlab 32 bit and 64 bit bindings, with Matlab examples.
- Python version 2.x and version 3.x bindings (compiled as wheel files) and
  Python examples.
- Java binding, with Java examples.
- The Gpufit manual in PDF format

## Examples

There are various examples that demonstrate the capabilities and usage of Gpufit. They can be found at the following locations:

- /examples/c++ - C++ examples for Gpufit
- /examples/c++/gpufit_cpufit - C++ examples that use Gpufit and Cpufit
- /examples/matlab - Matlab examples for Gpufit including spline fit examples (also requires [Gpuspline](https://github.com/gpufit/Gpuspline))
- /examples/python - Python examples for Gpufit including spline fit examples (also requires [Gpuspline](https://github.com/gpufit/Gpuspline))
- /Cpufit/matlab/examples - Matlab examples that only uses Cpufit
- /Gpufit/java/gpufit/src/test/java/com/github/gpufit/examples - Java examples for Gpufit

## Authors

Gpufit was created by Mark Bates, Adrian Przybylski, Björn Thiel, and Jan Keller-Findeisen at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, in Göttingen, Germany.
